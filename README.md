# PubTeX

This is a template for publicly hosting LaTeX files with GitHub actions.

It roughly works as follows:

1. You write your latex files as you would normally
2. Whenever you push your changes to `main`, your files are compiled and pushed to the `gh-pages` branch.
3. You can now download them directly or publish the branch with GitHub Pages

You also get this nice front page for free :)
